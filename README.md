> Real-Time Command Execution and Monitoring

This project is a Rust-based application that allows you to execute commands on a remote server and stream their output to a web client in real-time. It's designed to provide a mechanism for remotely executing tasks and monitoring their progress as they execute.

## Why It Exists

* **Real-Time Monitoring**: The project aims to provide a real-time monitoring system for command execution, allowing you to see the output as it's generated. This is useful for tasks that take a considerable amount of time to complete, such as software builds or data processing.
* **Task Management**: It can be used to manage and execute tasks remotely, which is especially valuable for scenarios where you need to distribute tasks across multiple machines and monitor their progress.
* **Centralized Control**: By centralizing the control of task execution and monitoring, you can have better control and visibility over your automated processes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

    Rust: Make sure you have the Rust programming language installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the official installation guide: Rust Installation Guide

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-command-execution.git
```

### Build the Project

Navigate to the project directory and build the Rust project:

```bash
cd real-time-command-execution
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration

You may need to configure the application by specifying the server address and other settings in the project's configuration files.

## Usage

### Start the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will start the Rust application, which will begin monitoring tasks and executing them as they become available.

### Client Interface

The client interface, which is not included in this project, can be implemented as a web application. The client can establish a WebSocket or SSE connection to the server to receive real-time updates on task progress and command output.

The client-side code should implement the logic for connecting to the server and displaying the output in a user-friendly manner.

### Task Execution

Tasks can be executed by sending a request to the server's API. The server will process the tasks and execute the associated commands, streaming their output to connected clients.
