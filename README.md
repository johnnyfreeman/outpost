The web interface is where pipelines and jobs are created.

## Api

The api can be explored using [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) and our [Bruno collection](/bruno).

## Agent

The agent will poll the API for jobs. To start an agent, it needs an `AGENT_ID` and an `API_HOST`. If these environment variables are not detected, you will be prompted for them.
